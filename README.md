**Project Description:** Predicting Customer Churn for a Telecommunications Company

**Project Objective:** To develop a model that can predict which customers are most likely to churn (cancel their service).

**Project Methodology:** This project will use data from a telecommunications company's customer database, including customer demographics, service usage, and billing information. The methodology will include data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model selection and tuning, and model evaluation. The chosen model will be deployed and tested on new data.

**Project Goal:** The goal of this project is to help the telecommunications company reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk customers and taking proactive measures to retain them.
